# Model Selection

## Bias, Variance and Model Complexity

### Error Measurement

**Training error.** The average loss over the training samples.

$$ \bar{err} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \hat{f}(x_i)) $$

**Test error (Generalization error).** The prediction error over an independent test sample.

$$ err_{\tau} = \mathbb{E}[L(Y, \hat{f}(X))|\tau] $$

where $\tau$ denotes the training set.

$$ err = \mathbb{E}[L(Y, \hat{f}(X))] = \mathbb{E}[err_{\tau}] $$

Note that the second formula does not condition on the training set $\tau$, so it is the expected test error over all possible training sets.

### Model Selection vs. Model Assessment

- **Model selection** estimates the performance of different models in order to choose the best one (performend on the validation set).
- **Model assessment** estimates the prediction error of the final model on new data (performed on the test set).
