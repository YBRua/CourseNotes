\section{Programs and Proofs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Law of Excluded Middle $\forall{Q} Q\vee\neg Q$
    \item $Programs \equiv Proofs$
\end{itemize}

Not all proofs have a corresponding program.

Let $isProgram(P)$ and $halts(P)$ be two predicates.
\[ \varphi \triangleq \forall{P} isProgram(P) \to halts(P) \vee \neg halts(P) \]
$\varphi$ is valid. i.e. $\vDash\varphi$. By completeness of first order logic, $\vdash\varphi$. So there must exist a proof (deduction) $\Phi=\{\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n\}$ s.t. $\varphi_n = \varphi$. If every proof had a corresponding program, then this program would be able to solve the Halting problem.

Not all programs have a corresponding proof.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
    while(1) {}
\end{lstlisting}

This program has a dead loop, which implies ``false''. If this program had a proof, then we would be able to prove ``false''.
