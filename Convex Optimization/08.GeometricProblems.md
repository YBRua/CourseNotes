## Projection on a Set

### Projecting a Point on a Set

**Distance.** The **distance** of a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ to a closed set $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ in the norm $\| \cdot \|$ is defined as

$$ \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C) = \inf\{ \|x_0 - y\| | y \in C \} $$

**Projection.** We refer to any point $z \in C$ which is the closest to $x_0$ ($\|z-x_0\| = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C)$) as a **projection** of $x_0$ on $C$.

We use the notation $P_C: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ to denote any function for which $P_C(x_0)$ is a projection of $x_0$ on $C$.

$$ P_C(x_0) \in C, \quad \| x_0 - P_C(x_0) \| = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C) $$

$P_C$ is referred to as **projection on $C$**.

#### Examples

### Projecting a Point on a Convex Set

We represent a convex set $C$ by a set of linear equalities and convex inequalitites.

$$ C = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n | Ax = b, f_i(x) \le 0 \} $$

The projection can be found by solving

$$ \begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| x - x_0 \|\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad f_i(x) \le 0 \\
    &\quad Ax = b
\end{align*} $$

- The problem is feasible iff $C$ is nonempty.
- When it is feasible, its optimal value $p^* = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C)$, and any optimal point is a projection of $x_0$ on $C$.

#### Projection on a Polyhedron

The projection of $x_0$ on a polyhedron described by $Ax \preceq b$ can be computed by solving the QP

$$ \begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| x - x_0 \|_2^2\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad Ax \preceq b
\end{align*} $$

Some special cases have simple analytical solutions

**Projection on a Hyperplane.** $C = \{ x | a^Tx = b \}$.

$$ P_C(x_0) = x_0 + (b - a^Tx_0) a /\|a\|^2 $$

**Projection on a Halfspace.** $C = \{ x | a^Tx \le b \}$.

$$ P_C(x_0) = \begin{cases}
    x_0 + (b-a^Tx_0)a/\|a\|^2&\quad a^Tx_0 > b\\
    x_0 &\quad a^Tx \le b
\end{cases} $$

### Separating a Point and a Convex Set

## Distance between Sets

**Distance between Two Sets.** The distance between two sets $C, D$ in a norm $\|\cdot\|$ is defined as

$$ \mathrm{dist}(C, D) = \inf \{ \| x - y \| | x \in C, y \in D \} $$

- The two sets $C$ and $D$ do not intersect if $\mathrm{dist}(C, D) > 0$.
- They intersect if $\mathrm{dist}(C,D) = 0$ and the infimum is attained.

The distance between $C$ and $D$ can be expressed in terms of the distance between a point and a set

$$ \mathrm{dist}(C, D) = \mathrm{dist}(0, D - C) $$

### Computing the Distance between Convex Sets

Assume $C$ and $D$ are described by two sets of convex inequalities

$$ C = \{ x | f_i(x) \le 0 \}, \quad D = \{ x | g_i(x) \le 0 \} $$

We find the distance by solving

$$\begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| x - y \|\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad f_i(x) \le 0 \\
    &\quad g_i(y) \le 0
\end{align*}$$

or equivalently

$$\begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| w \|\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad f_i(x) \le 0 \\
    &\quad g_i(y) \le 0\\
    &\quad x - y = w
\end{align*}$$

The Lagrangian is

$$ \mathcal{L}(x, y, w, \lambda, z, \mu) = \| w \| + \sum_i \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum_i \mu_i g_i(y) + z^T(x-y-w) $$

and the dual function is

$$ \begin{align*}
    g(\lambda, z, \mu) &= \inf_{x, y, w} \{ \| w \| + \sum_i \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum_i \mu_i g_i(y) + z^T(x-y-w) \} \\
    &= \inf_x \{ \sum_i \lambda_i f_i(x) + z^Tx \} + \inf_y \{ \sum_i \mu_i g_i(y) - z^T y \} + \inf_w\{ \|w\| - z^Tw \}\\
    &=\begin{cases}
        \inf_x \{ \sum_i \lambda_i f_i(x) + z^Tx \} + \inf_y \{ \sum_i \mu_i g_i(y) - z^T y \}, &\quad \|z\|_* \le 1\\
        -\infty, &\quad \|z\|_* > 1
    \end{cases}
\end{align*} $$

Therefore the dual problem is formuated as

$$ \begin{align*}
    \max_{\lambda, \mu, z} &\quad \inf_x \{ \sum_i \lambda_i f_i(x) + z^Tx \} + \inf_y \{ \sum_i \mu_i g_i(y) - z^T y \}\\
    &\quad \mathrm{s.t.} \|z\|_* \le 1, \lambda \ge 0, \mu \ge 0
\end{align*} $$

## Centering

### Chebyshev Center

**Depth.** Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be bounded and have nonempty interior, and $x \in C$. The **depth** of a point $x \in C$ is defined as

$$ \mathrm{depth}(x, C) = \mathrm{dist}(x, \mathbb{R}^n \backslash C) $$

**Chebyshev Center.** The **Chebyshev center** of the set $C$ is defined as any point of maximum depth in $C$.

$$ x_{cheb}(C) = \argmax \mathrm{depth}(x, C) = \argmax\mathrm{dist}(x, \mathbb{R}^n \backslash C) $$

- The Chebyshev center is a point inside $C$ that is farthest from the exterior of $C$.
- It is also the center of the largest ball that lies inside $C$.

#### Chebyshev Center of a Convex Set

Consider a convex set defined by convex inequalities

$$ C = \{ x | f_i(x) \le 0, i =1,\dots,m \} $$

We can find the Chebyshev center by solving

$$\begin{align*}
    \max &\quad R\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad g_i(x, R) \le 0
\end{align*}$$

where $g_i(x, R) = \sup_{\|u\|\le 1} f_i(x + Ru)$
