## Projection on a Set

### Projecting a Point on a Set

**Distance.** The **distance** of a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ to a closed set $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ in the norm $\| \cdot \|$ is defined as

$$ \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C) = \inf\{ \|x_0 - y\| | y \in C \} $$

**Projection.** We refer to any point $z \in C$ which is the closest to $x_0$ ($\|z-x_0\| = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C)$) as a **projection** of $x_0$ on $C$.

We use the notation $P_C: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ to denote any function for which $P_C(x_0)$ is a projection of $x_0$ on $C$.

$$ P_C(x_0) \in C, \quad \| x_0 - P_C(x_0) \| = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C) $$

$P_C$ is referred to as **projection on $C$**.

#### Examples

### Projecting a Point on a Convex Set

We represent a convex set $C$ by a set of linear equalities and convex inequalitites.

$$ C = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n | Ax = b, f_i(x) \le 0 \} $$

The projection can be found by solving

$$ \begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| x - x_0 \|\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad f_i(x) \le 0 \\
    &\quad Ax = b
\end{align*} $$

- The problem is feasible iff $C$ is nonempty.
- When it is feasible, its optimal value $p^* = \mathrm{dist}(x_0, C)$, and any optimal point is a projection of $x_0$ on $C$.

#### Projection on a Polyhedron

The projection of $x_0$ on a polyhedron described by $Ax \preceq b$ can be computed by solving the QP

$$ \begin{align*}
    \min &\quad \| x - x_0 \|_2^2\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} &\quad Ax \preceq b
\end{align*} $$

Some special cases have simple analytical solutions

**Projection on a Hyperplane.** $C = \{ x | a^Tx = b \}$.

$$ P_C(x_0) = x_0 + (b - a^Tx_0) a /\|a\|^2 $$

**Projection on a Halfspace.** $C = \{ x | a^Tx \le b \}$.

$$ P_C(x_0) = \begin{cases}
    x_0 + (b-a^Tx_0)a/\|a\|^2&\quad a^Tx_0 > b\\
    x_0 &\quad a^Tx \le b
\end{cases} $$
