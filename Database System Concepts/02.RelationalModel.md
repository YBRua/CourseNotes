## Relational Model

### Relation

- A **relation** is an *unordered* set of tuples. Each tuple represents an entity
- A tuple is a set of **attribute** values in the relation
- For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of *permitted values*, called the **domain** of that attribute
- Values in the tuple are (normally) atomic/scalar
  - A domain is **atomic** if elements of the domain are considered to be *indivisible* units
  - e.g. if an album has two artists, either we have to encode the two artists into an atomic one, or we have to store two records
- **null** entries stands for *unknown* or *does not exist*
  - Null values should be eliminated if possible

#### Terminalogies

- **Relation** is used to refer to a table
- **Tuple** is used to refer to a *row*
- **Attribute** is used to refer to a *column*

### Relation Schema

- Let $A_1,\dots,A_n$ be attributes. A **relation schema** contains a list of attributes and their corresponding domains. It is in the form of $R(A_1,\dots,A_n)$.

```text
Artists(Artist, Year, City)
```

#### Schema and Instances

- A relation schema corresponds to the programming notion of *type definition*
- A relation (instance) is a specific instance of a relation (containing a specific set of tuples). It corresponds to the programming notion of *variable*
- A **database schema** is a set of relatoin schemas in the database (logical design of the database)
- A **database instance** is a snapshot of the data in the database at a given time.

### Keys

In priciple, no two tuples in a relation are allowed to have exactly the same value for all attributes, although some commercial DBMS's allow duplicated tuples.

#### Superkey

A **superkey** $K \subseteq \{A_1,\dots,A_n\}$ is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, allows us to identify a *unique* tuple in a relation

Formally, let $R$ denote the set of attributes in the schema $r$, if a subset $K$ of $R$ is a *superkey* for $r$,

$$ t_1, t_2 \in r \land t_1 \neq t_2 \Longrightarrow t_1.K \neq t_2.K $$

- The attributes in a superkey may be *extraneous*. If $K$ is a superkey, then so will be any superset of $K$. A superkey $K$ is a **candidate key** if it is *minimal*, i.e. superkeys for which no proper subset is also a superkey
- It is possible that several distinct candidate keys exist. A **primary key** refers to a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the *principal* ways of identifying tuples in a relation
  - Primary keys of a relation schema is usually listed before other attributes, and are underlined

Primary keys are also referred to as **primary key constraints**, as the designation of a key represents a constraint that no two tuples can have the same values on the key attributes

#### Foreign Key

A **foreign key constraint** from attribute(s) $A$ of relation $r_1$ to the *primary key* $B$ of relation $r_2$ states that on any database instance, the value of $A$ for each tuple in $r_1$ must also be the value of $B$ for some tuple in $r_2$.

- Attribute set $A$ is called a **foreign key** from $r_1$ referencing $r_2$
- $r_1$ is also called the **referencing relation**
- $r_2$ is also called the **referenced relation**

> "An instructor cannot belong to a department that does not exist"

##### Integrity Constraints

###### Foreign Key Constraint

The referenced attribute(s) must be the *primary key* of the referenced relation

- Most DBMS supports this constraint

###### Referential Integrity Contraint

Values of specified attributes appearing in specified attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation must also appear in specified attributes of some tuples in the referenced relation

- Relaxed version of the foreign key constraint

## Relational Algebra

The **relational algebra** consists of a set operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation as output. It contains fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation.

We only cover 6 basic operations and the join operation here.

- Select
- Project
- Product
- Join (not a basic operation)
- Union
- Difference
- Rename

### Select

Choose a subset of the tuples from a relation $R$ that satisfies a **selection predicate** $p$

#### Syntax

$$ \sigma_p(R) $$

##### Example

$$\sigma_{deptName=``Physics"}(instructor)$$

#### Selection Predicate

- Can use $=, \neq, >, \ge, <, \le$ in the selection predicate
- Can combine several predicates with $\land, \lor, \neg$

### Project

Generate a relation with tuples that contains only the *specified values* (with certain attributes left out)

- Can be used to rearrange ordering of attributes
- Can be used to manipulate the values

#### Syntax

$$ \Pi_{A_1,\dots,A_k}(R) $$

##### Example

$$ \Pi_{ID,name,salary}(instructor) $$

A generalized version of the Project operator allows expressions involving attributes to appear

$$ \Pi_{ID,name,salary/12}(instructor) $$

### (Cartesian-)Product

Generates a relation that contains all possible combinations of tuples from the input relations

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two relations,

$$ R \times S $$

#### Example

- $R(A_1,\dots,A_n)$
- $S(B_1,\dots,B_m)$

$R \times S$ yields

$$(R.A_1,\dots,R.A_n,S.B_1,\dots,S.B_m)$$

- We attach the attribute to the name of the relation it belongs to, to avoid duplicated attribute names coming from different relations
- Note that the product of a relation with itself, $R \times R$, would lead to duplicated attribute names. This will be resolved later when the rename operator is introduced.
- The product operation may yield "meaningless" tuples
  - Therefore product is often used in combination with select
    - $\sigma_{instructor.id = teaches.id}(instructor \times teaches)$
  - To simplify the operation, the operator "theta join" is introduced

### Join

The (theta) join operation allows us to combine a selection and a product into a single operation

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two relations

$$ R \Join_\theta S := \sigma_\theta(R \times S) $$

where $\theta$ is a selection predicate

#### Example

$$ instructor \Join_{instructor.id = teaches.id} teaches $$

#### Natural Join

$$ R \Join S $$

Has an implicit predicate that requires *equality* over those attributes that appear in the schemas of both $R$ and $S$

### Set Operations

#### Union

Generates a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations

##### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two compatible relations

$$ R \cup S $$

Note that for the union operation to make sense, $R$ and $S$ must be **compatible**

- $R,S$ must have the same number of attributes
- The attribute domains must be compatible (i.e. the types of each attribute of the two inputs must be the same)

##### Semantics of Set Operations

- Set Semantics
  - Duplicated tuples are not allowed
- Bag (Multiset) Semantics
  - Duplicated tuples are allowed

#### Difference

Generates a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in the first and not in the second of the input relations

##### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two compatible relations

$$ R - S$$

### Rename

Rename a relation, and/or the names of the attributes

#### Syntax

$$\rho_x(E)$$

returns the result of expression $E$ under the name $x$

$$ \rho_{x(A_1,\dots,A_n)}(E) $$

returns the result of expression $E$ under the name $x$ with attributes $A_1,\dots,A_n$

#### Example

Find the ID and name of those instructors, whose salary is higher than that of the instructor whose ID is 12121

$$ \Pi_{i.ID,i.name}((\sigma_{i.salary>w.salary}(\rho_i(instructor) \times \sigma_{w.id=12121}(\rho_w(instructor)))) $$

### Composition of Relational Operation

The result of a relational algebra is still a relation. Therefore relational algebra operations can be composed together into a **relational algebra expression**

For example

$$ \Pi_{name}(\sigma_{deptName="Physics"}(instructor)) $$

### Other

#### Join

Mentioned before, but not a basic operation.

#### Intersection

- Generates a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in both of the input relations
- Belongs to set operations

$$ R \cap S $$

#### Assignment

Assigns part of the results in a relational algebra expression to a *temporary relation variable*. Similar to the assignment operator in programming languages

$$ R \leftarrow S $$

For example

$$ courses\_fall\_2017 \leftarrow \Pi_{course\_id}(\sigma_{semester=Fall \wedge year=2017}(section)) $$

- Results are only *temporary*
- Does not provide extra functionality to the algebra. It only makes things more convenient

#### Aggregation

Allows a function to be computed over the set of values returned by a query, including average, sum, minimum, maximum, etc.

#### Sorting

#### Division

Let $r(R)$ and $s(S)$ be two relations, with $S \subseteq R$. Let $t[S]$ denote the result of tuple $t$ projected on the attributes in $S$. Then $r \div s$ is a relation on $R-S$, a tuple is in $r \div s$ iff

- $t \in \Pi_{R-S}(r)$
- For each tuple $t_s$ in $s$, there is a tuple $t_r$ in $r$ s.t.
  - $t_r[S] = t_s[S]$
  - $t_r[R-S] = t$

The result (denoted by $T$) include all attributes and values that are in $R$ but not in $S$. Further, all combinations of $T$ and $S$ are in $R$
