# Relational Model of Data

> The most successful database abstraction

## Relational Model

### Relation

- A **relation** is an *unordered* set of tuples. Each tuple represents an entity
- A tuple is a set of **attribute** values (a.k.a. **domain**) in the relation
- Values in the tuple are (normally) atomic/scalar
  - e.g. if an album has two artists, either we have to encode the two artists into an atomic one, or we have to store two records
- **null** entries stands for *unknown* instead of *empty*

#### Terminalogies

- **Relation** is used to refer to a table
- **Tuple** is used to refer to a *row*
- **Attribute** is used to refer to a *column*

### Relation Schema

- Let $A_1,\dots,A_n$ be attributes. A **relation schema** contains a list of attributes and their corresponding domains. It is in the form of $R(A_1,\dots,A_n)$.

```text
Artists(Artist, Year, City)
```

### Keys

#### Superkey

- A **superkey** $K \subseteq \{A_1,\dots,A_n\}$ is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, allows us to identify a *unique* tuple in a relation
  - A superkey $K$ is a **candidate key** if it is *minimal*, i.e. superkeys for which no proper subset is also a superkey
  - A **primary key** refers to a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the *principal* ways of identifying tuples in a relation
    - Primary keys of a relation schema is usually listed before other attributes, and are underlined

#### Foreign Key

- A **foreign key** specifies that a tuple from one relation must map to a tuple in another relation

#### Integrity Constraints

##### Foreign Key Constraint

The referenced attribute(s) must be the primary key of the referenced relation

- Most DBMS supports this constraint

##### Referential Integrity Contraint

Value in one relation must appear in another

## Relational Algebra

The **relational algebra** consists of a set operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation as output. It contains fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation.

We only cover 6 basic operations and the join operation here.

- Select
- Project
- Product
- Join (not a basic operation)
- Union
- Difference
- Rename

### Select

Choose a subset of the tuples from a relation $R$ that satisfies a **selection predicate** $p$

#### Syntax

$$ \sigma_p(R) $$

##### Example

$$\sigma_{deptName="Physics"}(instructor)$$

#### Selection Predicate

- Can use $=, \neq, >, \ge, <, \le$ in the selection predicate
- Can combine several predicates with $\land, \lor, \neg$

### Project

Generate a relation with tuples that contains only the *specified values*

- Can be used to rearrange ordering of attributes
- Can be used to manipulate the values

#### Syntax

$$ \Pi_{A_1,\dots,A_k}(R) $$

##### Example

$$ \Pi_{ID,name,salary}(instructor) $$

### Product

Generates a relation that contains all possible combinations of tuples from the input relations

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two relations,

$$ R \times S $$

#### Example

- $R(A_1,\dots,A_n)$
- $S(B_1,\dots,B_m)$

$R \times S$ yields

$$(R.A_1,\dots,R.A_n,S.B_1,\dots,S.B_m)$$

- Note that $R \times R$ would lead to duplicated attribute names. This will be fixed later when the rename operator is introduced.
- The product operation may yield "meaningless" tuples
  - Therefore product is often used in combination with select
    - $\sigma_{instructor.id = teaches.id}(instructor \times teaches)$
  - To simplify the operation, the operator "theta join" is introduced

### Join

The (theta) join operation allows us to combine a selection and a product into a single operation

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two relations

$$ R \Join_\theta S $$

where $\theta$ is a selection predicate

#### Example

$$ instructor \Join_{instructor.id = teaches.id} teaches $$

#### Natural Join

$$ R \Join S $$

Has an implicit predicate that requires *equality* over those attributes that appear in both $R$ and $S$

### Union

Generates a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two compatible relations

$$ R \cup S $$

Note that for the union operation to make sense,

- $R,S$ must have the same number of attributes
- The attribute domains must be compatible

#### Semantics of Union

- Set Semantics
  - Duplicated tuples are not allowed
- Bag (Multiset) Semantics
  - Duplicated tuples are allowed

### Difference

Generates a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in the first and not in the second of the input relations

#### Syntax

Let $R,S$ be two compatible relations

$$ R - S$$

### Rename

Rename a relation, and/or the names of the attributes

#### Syntax

$$\rho_x(E)$$

returns the result of expression $E$ under the name $x$

$$ \rho_{x(A_1,\dots,A_n)}(E) $$

returns the result of expression $E$ under the name $x$ with attributes $A_1,\dots,A_n$

### Composition of Relational Operation

The result of a relational algebra is still a relation. Therefore relational algebra operations can be composed together into a **relational algebra expression**

For example

$$ \Pi_{name}(\sigma_{deptName="Physics"}(instructor)) $$

### Other

- Join
- Intersection $\cap$
- Assignment $R \leftarrow S$
- Aggregation $\gamma$
- Sorting $\tau$
- Division $R \div S$
