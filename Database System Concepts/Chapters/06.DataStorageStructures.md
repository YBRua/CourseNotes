# Data Storage Structures

## Introduction

### Classification of Physical Storage Media

- Volatile Storage: Loses contents when power is switched off
  - SRAM
  - Random access
- Non-volatile Storage: Contents persist even if power is switched off
  - SSD, HDD, network storage
  - Sequential access, block-addressable

### Design Goals

- Allow DBMS to manage databases that exceed the amount of available memory
- Avoid large stalls and performance degradation caused by disk read/write

### Database System Architectures

- Storage Management
  - How the DBMS represents and organizes the database on disk
- Buffer Management
  - How the DBMS manages the movement of data between non-volatile and volatile storage

## Storage Management

- DBMS stores a database as one or more files on disk
- Database files are organized as a collection of **pages**
- The storage manager is responsible for maintaining a database's file
  - Tracks data read from/written to pages
  - Tracks available space

### Database Pages

- Similar to pages in OS memory management
- A page is a fixed-size block of data
  - Contains tuples, meta-data, indexes and log records
  - Some systems require a page to be self-contained
- Each page is given a unique identifier
  - The DBMS use an indirection layer to map identifiers to physical locations
  - Implemented as a page directory table

#### Different Pages

- Hardware Page (4KB)
- OS Page (4KB)
- Database Page (512B - 16KB), depending on database system implementation

#### Ways of Page Storage Management

Different DBMS manages pages in different ways. There are mainly three categories

- Heap file oraganization
- Sequential/Sorted file
- Hashing file organization

##### Database Heap

A heap file is an unordered collection of pages where tuples are stored in random order

- Need additional meta-data to keep track of what pages exist and which pages have free spaces
- Typically implemented as linked lists or page directories

###### Linked List

- The DBMS maitain a header page that stores two pointers
  - Head of **free page list**
  - Head of **data page list**
- Each page independently keeps track of number of free spaces in itself

###### Page Directory

- The DBMS maintains special pages that tracks the location of data pages in database files
- The directory also records the number of free slots per pages

#### Page Structure

Every page contains a header of meta-data about the page's contents

- Page Size
- Checksum
- Transaction Visibility
- Compression Information

#### Slotted Pages

Slotted pages is the most commonly used page layout scheme

Contains a **header** a **slot array** and several **tuples**

- The slot array is stored at the beginning of a page (after the header)
  - Maps slots to the tuples' starting position offsets
  - Spans toward the end of the page
- The header is located at the end of the page
  - Keeps track of used slots, and the offset of the starting location of the last slot used
  - Spans toward the beginnin of a page

### Tuple Structure

- A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes, the DBMS is responsible for interpreting the bytes
- Each tuple is prefixed with a **header** that contains its meta-data
  - Visibility info (for concurrency control)
  - Bit map for tracking null values
- Attribute bytes are typically stored in the order that they are specified when creating the table

#### Tuple IDs

- The DBMS uses tuple IDs to keep track of individual tuples
- Each tuple is assigned a unique record identifier
  - Most commonly format is `page_id + offset/slot`
- Designed only for internal use in the DBMS, and an application should not rely on these IDs

#### Size Overflow Control

- Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a single page
- To store values that are larger than a page, the DBMS may use separate overflow storage pages

### System Catalog

- A DBMS stores meta-data about databases in its internal catalog
  - Including list of tables, columns, indexes, and views
- Almost every DBMS stores their catalog as a **private database**
