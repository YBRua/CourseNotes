# Crash Recovery

> 奔 溃 一 致 性

## Introduction

### Assumptions

- Database is stored on non-volatile storage, whose access time is much slower than memory
- We use the memory as a buffer pool for faster access
- Contents in on-volatile storage are assumed to not be corrupted when the system crashes

### Crash Recovery Algorithm

A recovery algorithm has two parts

1. Logging: Actions taken during normal transaction execution, to ensure enough information exists to recover in case a failure occurs
2. Recovery: Actions taken after a crash occurred to ensure atomicity, consistency and durability

### Classification of Failures

- Transaction Failures
  - **Logical Errors**: Transaction cannot complete due to some internal conation
  - **System Errors**: The transaction must be terminated due to an erroneous condition in the DBMS itself (e.g. a deadlock)
- System Crash
  - A power failure, or a hardware or software error that causes the DBMS to crash
- Disk Failure
  - Recovery algorithms are not designed to handle this case

## Log-Based Recovery

### Log

- A log is a sequence of **log records** which keeps information about the update activities on the database
  - The log is kept on *non-volatile storage*

!!!note Intuition of Logging
    Write what the DBMS **plan to do** in the log with enough information to tell the DBMS whether it has been done or not.

#### Log Records

- `<T[i] start>`: Transaction $T_i$ has started
- `<T[i], X, V1, V2>`: $T_i$ executes $W(X)$ to update its value from $V_1$ to $V-2$
- `<T[i] commit>`: $T_i$ has commited
- `<T[i] abort>`: $T_i$ has aborted

#### Write Ahead Logging (WAL)

- Log records that corresponds to changes made to a database object must be written to disk **before** it can flush the object to disk
- If the system crashes, we can infer what should be recovered by reading the commited logs

1. Log records are outputted to disk in the order in which they are created
2. Transaction $T_i$ enters the commit state only when the log record `T[i] commit` has been saved to stable storage
3. Before a block of data in the buffer is written to disk, all *log records pertaining to the data in that block must have been written back to disk*

- WAL can be used to undo incomplete transactions, and redo committed ones
- WAL enables **Steal + No Force** buffer pool policy
  - **Steal**: Allow writing dirty pages to disk
  - **No Force** Allows write as little as possbile

#### Undo (Atomicity)

- For an uncommitted transaction $T$, all data items updated by $T$ are restored to their original values
  - The undo is processed *backwards* until `<T start>` is encountered
  - After undoing $T$, a `<T abort>` is written to log
- Ensures *atomicity*

##### Undo and Steal Policy

Whether to allow buffer-pool pages with *uncommited* updates to overwrite commited data on disk

- A steal policy requires undo mechanisms to remove uncommited changes and ensure atomicity
  - Usually a steal policy has good runtime performance
- A no-steal policy is useful for ensuring atomicity without undo logging
  - But can have poor performance, especially when updating a large table

#### Redo (Durability)

- For a committed transaction $T$, all data items updated by $T$ are set to their new values
  - The redo is processed forward from the first log record of $T$
  - No logging is done in the redo process
  - Ensures *durability*

##### Redo and Force Policy

Whether to require all updates made by a transaction are reflected on disk before the transaction is allowed to commit

- A force policy ensures durability even without redo logging
  - Poor performance: many random writes at commit time
- A no-force policy requires redo to ensure durability
  - Good performance: random writes can be merged and reduced

### Checkpointing

- Undoing or redoing the entire log is very expensive
- DBMS periodically takes a checkpoint, where it flushes all buffers to disk
- Reduces cost to recover from crash

At a checkpoint

- Output all log records existing in memory to disk
- Output all modified blocks in the buffer to the disk
- Write a log `<checkpoint L>` to disk
  - where `L` is a list of transactions that are active at the time of the checkpoint
- All other updates are stopped at the checkpoint (which may affect performance)
  - Can be alleviated by fuzzy checkpointing (beyond the scope)

With checkpointing, the DBMS only need to consider *the most recent transaction $T_i$ that started before the checkpoint*, and other transactions after $T_i$

1. Scan backward along the log to find the checkpoint
2. Only transactions in $L$ and those started after the checkpoint need to be recovered

## Recovery

### Overview of the Recovery Algorithm

- The recovery algorithm should take care of two issues
  - Transaction rollback during normal operation
  - Recovery from system failure

### Transcation Rollback

- Let $T_i$ be a transaction that needs to be rolled back
  - The algorithm scans the log backward from the end
  - For each log record $T_i$ `<T[i], X, V1, V2>`
    - Undo the write
    - Write a compensation log `<T[i], X, V1>`
      - In case another crash occurs during recovery
  - Until `<T[i] start>` is encounted
  - Adda log record `<T[i] abort>`

### Recovery after System Crash

- **Redo phase (Repeat history)**: Replay update of all transactions, no matter they are comitted, aborted or incomplete
- **Undo phase**: Undo all incomplete transactions

#### Redo Phase

1. Find checkpoint $L$, set **undo list** to $L$
2. Scan forward from the checkpoint record and repeat the history
   - When a `<T[i] start>` is encountered, add $T_i$ to undo list
   - When a `T[i] commit` or `T[i] abort` is encountered, remove $T_i$ from the undo list
