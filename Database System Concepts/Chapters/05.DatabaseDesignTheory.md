# Database Design Theory

> Designing a good database schema and ensuring the integrity

## Notations

- $X$ represents a set of attributes
- $A_i$ represents a single attribute
- $XY$ represents $X \cup Y$

## Functional Dependencies

Consider a relation schema $r(R)$, let $X \subseteq R$ and $Y \subseteq R$

$X \to Y$ is a **functional dependency** on relation $R$ if whenever two tuples $(t_1, t_2)$ agree on the attributes of $X$, then they must also agree on the attribute $Y$

$$ X \to Y \Rightarrow (t_1[x] = t_2[x] \Rightarrow t_1[y] = t_2[y]) $$

!!!note
    Functional dependencies can be verified on *database instances*, but cannot be proved as part of the schema

Functional dependencies works as a "unique value constraint".

### Trivial FDs

A functional dependency $X \to Y$ is **trivial** if $Y \subseteq X$, because these FDs are satsified by all relations.

### Logical Implication of FD

Let $S$ and $T$ be two sets of FDs, $S$ **logically implies** $T$ if every relation instance that satisfies $S$ also satisfies $T$

!!!example
    $ \{ A \to B, B \to C \} $ logically implies $A \to C$

#### Closure

The set of all functional dependencies logically implied by $F$ is the **closure** of $F$, denoted by $F^+$

##### Armstrong's Axioms

Properties of Functional Dependencies

- Reflexivity: $X \supseteq Y \Rightarrow X \to Y$
- Augmentation: $X \to Y \Rightarrow XZ \to YZ$
- Transitivity: $(X \to Y) \wedge (Y \to Z) \Rightarrow X \to Z$
- Union: $(X \to Y) \wedge (X \to Z) \Rightarrow X \to YZ$
- Decomposition: $X \to YZ \Rightarrow (X \to Y) \wedge (X \to Z)$
- Pseudo-transitivity: $(X \to Y) \wedge (YW \to Z) \Rightarrow XW \to Z$

The system of Armstrong's Axioms is both sound and complete.

- All generated FDs are correct (in $F^+$)
- All FDs in $F^+$ can be generated

And therefore these axioms can be used for generating closures.

#### Closure of Attribute Sets

Given a set of attributes $X$, define the **closure** of $X$ **under** $F$ as the set of attributes that are functionally determined by $F^+$, denoted by $X^+$

$$ X^+ \triangleq \{ Y | X \to Y \in F^+ \} $$

```py
while changed(X):
    for x, y in F:
        if x in X and x.implies(y):
            X.add(y)
```

##### Usage of Attribute Closure

- Testing for superkey
  - Check if $X^+$ contains all attributes of $R$
- Testing functional dependencies
  - Check if $Y \subseteq X^+$
- Computing closure of $F$
  - ...

## Canonical Cover

Whenever a relation is updated, the database system must ensure the update to the relation does not violate any functional dependencies.

### Extraneous Attributes

Consider a set $F$ of functional dependencies and the functional dependency $X \to Y$ in $F$

Attribute $X$ is **extraneous** in $X$ if

- $A \in X$
- $F$ logically implies $F - \{ X \to Y \} \cup \{ (X - A) \to Y \}$

Attribute $Y$ is **extraneous** in $Y$ if

- $A \in Y$
- $( F - \{ X \to Y \} \cup \{ X \to (Y - A) \} )$ logically implies $F$

That is, we can safely drop some attributes without changing the closure of the set of functional dependencies.

### Definition of Canonical Cover

A **canonical cover** for $F$ is a set of dependencies $F_c$ such that

- $F$ logically implies all dependencies in $F_c$
- $F_c$ logically implies all dependencies in $F$
- No functional dependency in $F_c$ contains an extraneous attribute
- $X_1 \to Y_1$ and $X_2 \to Y_2$ s.t. $X_1 = Y_1$

### Usage of Canonical Covers

- The canonical cover is the minimum set of assertions required to maintain the correctness and integrity of the database
- Canonical covers can be used to find superkeys

### Computing Canonical Cover

1. Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in $F$ of the form
   - $X_1 \to Y_1$ and $X_1 \to Y_2$ with $X_1 \to Y_1Y_2$
2. Find a functional dependency $X \to Y$ in $F$

## Schema Decomposition

### Normalization Theory

The normalization theory is used for determining whether a particular relation $R$ is in "good" (normal) form. If not, it decomposes it into smaller relations that is in normal form and avoids anormalies

### Goals of Decomposition

- Lossless joins
  - Be able to reconstruct the original relation by joining smaller ones using natural joins
- Dependency preservation
  - Minimize the cost of global integrity constraints based on FDs
- Redundancy avoidance
  - Avoid unnecessary data duplication
