# Database Design Theory

> Designing a good database schema and ensuring the integrity

## Notations

- $X$ represents a set of attributes
- $A_i$ represents a single attribute
- $XY$ represents $X \cup Y$
- For a schema $R$ and a relation $r$, $r(R)$ represents that schema $R$ is for $r$, i.e. a relation with schema $R$

## Functional Dependencies

Some of the moset commonly used types of real-world constraints can be represented formally as keys, or as functional dependencies.

### Keys

Given $r(R)$, a subset $K$ of $R$ is a superkey of $r(R)$ if, in any legal instance of $r(R)$, for all pairs $t_1$ and $t_2$ of tuples in the instance of $r$, if $t_1 \neq t_2$, then $t_1[K]\neq t_2[K]$

That is, no two tuples may have the same value on attribute set $K$

### Functional Dependency

Consider a relation schema $r(R)$, let $X \subseteq R$ and $Y \subseteq R$

$X \to Y$ is a **functional dependency** on relation $R$ if whenever two tuples $(t_1, t_2)$ agree on the attributes of $X$, then they must also agree on the attribute $Y$

$$ X \to Y \Rightarrow (t_1[x] = t_2[x] \Rightarrow t_1[y] = t_2[y]) $$

!!!note
    Functional dependencies can be verified on *database instances*, but cannot be proved as part of the schema

#### Functional Dependency and Superkey

> Functional dependencies works as a "unique value constraint".

We say $K$ is a superkey for $r(R)$ if the functional dependency $K \to R$ holds on $r(R)$

### Trivial FDs

A functional dependency $X \to Y$ is **trivial** if $Y \subseteq X$, because these FDs are satsified by all relations.

### Logical Implication of FD

Let $S$ and $T$ be two sets of FDs, $S$ **logically implies** $T$ if every relation instance that satisfies $S$ also satisfies $T$.

Given that a set of functional dependencies $F$ holds on a relation $r(R)$, it may be possible to infer that certain other functional dependencies must also hold on the relation.

!!!example
    $ \{ A \to B, B \to C \} $ logically implies $A \to C$

#### Closure

The set of all functional dependencies logically implied by $F$ is the **closure** of $F$, denoted by $F^+$,

##### Armstrong's Axioms

We use axioms, or rules of inference, to reason about functional dependencies in a simpler way. This collection of axioms is known as **Armstrong's Axioms**

- Reflexivity: $X \supseteq Y \Rightarrow X \to Y$
- Augmentation: $X \to Y \Rightarrow XZ \to YZ$
- Transitivity: $(X \to Y) \wedge (Y \to Z) \Rightarrow X \to Z$
- Union: $(X \to Y) \wedge (X \to Z) \Rightarrow X \to YZ$
- Decomposition: $X \to YZ \Rightarrow (X \to Y) \wedge (X \to Z)$
- Pseudo-transitivity: $(X \to Y) \wedge (YW \to Z) \Rightarrow XW \to Z$

Note that the original version of Armstrong's Axioms consists of only the first three axioms. The latter three can be inferred from the first three.

The system of Armstrong's Axioms is both sound and complete.

- All generated FDs are correct (in $F^+$)
- All FDs in $F^+$ can be generated

And therefore these axioms can be used for generating closures.

### Closure of Attribute Sets

Given an attribute $B$ and a set of attributes $X$, $B$ is **functionally determined** by $X$ if $X \to B$

Given a set of attributes $X$ and a set of FDs $F$, define the **closure** of $X$ **under** $F$ as the set of attributes that are functionally determined by $X$ under $F$, denoted by $X^+$

$$ X^+ \triangleq \{ Y | X \to Y \in F^+ \} $$

#### Algorithm for Attribute Set Closures

```py
result = X
while result.changed():
    for x, y in F:  # for each FD x -> y in F
        if x in result:
            result.add(y)
```

#### Usage of Attribute Closure

- Testing for superkey $X \to R$
  - Check if $X^+$ contains all attributes of $R$
- Testing functional dependencies $X \to Y$
  - Check if $Y \subseteq X^+$
- Computing closure of $F$
  - For each $\gamma \subseteq R$, we find the closure $\gamma^+$, and for each $S \subseteq \gamma^+$, we output $\gamma \to S$

## Canonical Cover

Whenever a relation is updated, the database system must ensure the update to the relation does not violate any functional dependencies. Otherwise, the system must roll back the update.

Therefore, we need a minimal set of functional dependencies that have the same closure as a given set of FDs, in order to reduce the effort for checking violations.

### Extraneous Attributes

Consider a set $F$ of functional dependencies and the functional dependency $X \to Y$ in $F$

Attribute $A$ is **extraneous** in $X$ if

- $A \in X$
- $F$ logically implies $F - \{ X \to Y \} \cup \{ (X - A) \to Y \}$

!!! example
    Removing an attribute from the left side results in a stronger constraint. ($AB \to C$ becomes $A \to C$)

    $ A \to C $ logically implies $AB \to C$, but $AB \to C$ does not (on its own) imply $A \to C$

Attribute $Y$ is **extraneous** in $Y$ if

- $A \in Y$
- $( F - \{ X \to Y \} \cup \{ X \to (Y - A) \} )$ logically implies $F$

!!! example
    Removing an attribute from the right side results in a weaker constraint. ($AB \to CD$ becomes $AB \to C$).

    $AB \to CD$ implies $AB \to C$, but only from $AB \to C$ we cannot recover $AB \to D$

That is, we can safely drop some attributes without changing the closure of the set of functional dependencies.

!!! note
    Notice the direction of the implications, the reversed implications would always hold.

#### Computing Extraneous Attributes

Consider an attribute $A$ and an FD $X \to Y$

- If $A \in X$, let $Z = X - A$, and check if $Z \to Y$ can be inferred from $F$
  1. Compute $Z^+$ under $F$.
  2. If $Z^+$ includes all attributes in $Y$, then $A$ is extraneous
- If $A \in Y$, let $F' = F - \{ X \to Y \} \cup \{ X \to (Y - A) \}$, and check if $X \to A$ can be infered from $F'$
  1. Compute $X^+$ under $F'$
  2. If $A \in X^+$, then $A$ is extraneous

### Definition of Canonical Cover

A **canonical cover** for $F$ is a set of dependencies $F_c$ such that

- $F$ logically implies all dependencies in $F_c$
- $F_c$ logically implies all dependencies in $F$
- No functional dependency in $F_c$ contains an extraneous attribute
- Each left side of a functional dependecny in $F_c$ is unique: There are no two dependencies $X_1 \to Y_1$ and $X_2 \to Y_2$ such that $X_1 = Y_1$

### Algorithm for Canonical Cover

```python
cover = F
while cover.changed():
    # merge X1 -> Y1 and X1 -> Y2 into X1 -> Y1Y2
    cover.merge_by_union_rule()

    # find and remove any extraneous attributes
    extra = cover.get_extraneous_attrs()
    if extra:
        cover.remove(extra)
```

It is possible that there may be several possible canonical covers for a given $F$.

### Usage of Canonical Covers

- The canonical cover is the minimum set of assertions required to maintain the correctness and integrity of the database
- Canonical covers can be used to find superkeys

### Computing Canonical Cover

1. Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in $F$ of the form
   - $X_1 \to Y_1$ and $X_1 \to Y_2$ with $X_1 \to Y_1Y_2$
2. Find a functional dependency $X \to Y$ in $F$

## Schema Decomposition

### Normalization Theory

The normalization theory is used for determining whether a particular relation $R$ is in "good" (normal) form. If not, it decomposes it into smaller relations that is in normal form and avoids anormalies.

The method for designing a relational database is to use a process commonly known as normalization.

### Goals of Decomposition

- Lossless joins
  - Be able to reconstruct the original relation by joining smaller ones using natural joins
  - Mandatory goal
- Dependency preservation
  - Minimize the cost of global integrity constraints based on FDs
  - Nice to have, but not required
- Redundancy avoidance
  - Avoid unnecessary data duplication
  - Nice to have, but not required

#### Lossless Decomposition via Functional Decompostion

A decomposition of $R$ into $R_1$ and $R_2$ is a **lossless decomposition** if at least one of the following dependencies is in $F^+$

- $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_1$
- $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_2$

That is, $R_1 \cap R_2$ forms a superkey for either $R_1$ or $R_2$

#### Dependency Preservation

Let $F$ be a set of functional dependencies on $R$, and let $R_1,\dots,R_n$ be a decomposition of $R$. Define the **restriction of $F$ to $R_i$** be the set $F_i$ of all functional dependencies in $F^+$ that include only attributes of $R_i$.

Let $F' = \bigcup_i F_i$, the decomposition is said to be a **dependency-preserving decomposition** if $F'^+ = F^+$. That is, every dependency in $F$ is logically implied by $F'$, and by checking $F'$ we can check if $F$ is satisfied.

Informally, a schema decomposition preserves dependencies if its original FDs do not span over multiple tables. That is, we do not need to join tables to check some of the FDs. It could be expensive to check dependencies otherwise.

## Normal Forms

### Goals for Decomposition

#### Lossless Joins

- Motivation: Avoid information loss
- Goal: No noise when reconstructing universal relation via joins
- Test: At each decomopsition $R = (R_1, R_2)$, check either $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_1$ or $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_2$

#### Dependency Preservation

- Motivation: Efficient FD implementation
- Goal: No global FD requries joining more than one table
- Test: $F'^+ = F^+$ where $F' = \bigcup_i F_i$

#### Redundancy Avoidance

- Motivation: Avoid update and delete anomalies
- Goal: Avoid anomalies and wasting space
- Test: For an $X \to Y$ covered by $R_i$, $X$ should be a superkey of $R_i$

### First Normal Form (1NF)

A relational schema $R$ is in **first normal form (1NF)** if the domains of all atributes of $R$ are atomic.

By **atmoic**, we mean that the elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

A relation schema $R$ is in **second normal form (2NF)** if $R$ is in 1NF, and all non-key attributes fully depend on the candidate key.

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A relation schema $R$ is in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** with respect to a set $F$ of functional dependencies if for all functional dependencies in $F^+$ of the form $X \to Y$, where $X,Y \subseteq R$, at least one of the following holds,

- $X \to Y$ is trivial ($Y \subseteq X$)
- $X$ is a superkey for $R$ ($A \to R \in F^+$)

#### General Rule for BCNF Decomposition

Let $R$ be a schema that is not in BCNF

- There is at least one non-trivial functional dependency $X \to Y$ s.t. $X$ is not a superkey of $R$
- Replace $R$ with $X \cup Y$ and $R - X \cup Y$

```python
def bncf_decomposition(R, F):
    result = set(R)
    closure = compute_closure(F)
    while exists r_i in R not in BCNF:
        choose (X, Y) in closure covered by r_i and X is not primary key of r_i

        # decompose r_i according to the rules
        r_i1 = X + Y
        r_i2 = r_i - (X + Y)
        result.add(r_i1, r_i2)
    return result
```

#### Properties of BCNF

- BCNF decomposition ensures lossless join
- BCNF decomposition can eliminate redundancies that can be discovered based on functional dependencies (not all redundancies can be eliminated)
- BCNF decomopsition does not ensure dependency preservation

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A relation $R$ with a FD set $F$ is in **third normal form** with respect to $F$ if for all functional dependencies in $F^+$ of the form $X \to Y$, where $X,Y \subseteq R$, at least one of the following holds

- $X \to Y$ is trivial
- $X$ is a superkey of $R$
- Each attribute $A$ in $Y - X$ is contained in a candidate key for $R$

!!! note
    Different from textbook, in the slide, the third condition is *Y is part of a candidate key of $R$*

- 3NF is a weaker normal form than BCNF
  - Since it has an additional alternative compared to BCNF
- 3NF preserves dependencies, but may have anomalies

#### Algorithm for 3NF

It is always possible to obtain a lossless and dependency-preserving 3NF design, at the cost of using null values to represent some of the possibly meaningful relationshipes among data items

```python
def third_nf_synthesis(R, F):
    cc = canonical_cover(F)
    result = set()
    for X, Y in cc:
        r_i = Relation(X, Y)
        result.add(r_i)
    if no relation in result contains candidate key for R:
        Z = candidate key of R
        result.add(Relation(Z))
    result.remove_redundant_relations() # optional

    return result
```
