# Structured Query Language

## SQL Data Definition

### Basic Types

- `char(n)`: Fixed-size character string with length `n`
- `varchar(n)`: Variable-length character with maximum length `n`
- `int`: Integer
- `smallint`: Small integer, a machine-dependent subset of `int`
- `numeric(p, d)`: Fixed point number with user-specified precision
- `real, double precision`: Floating point and double-precision floating point numbers
- `float(n)`: Floating point with precision of at least `n` digits

Each type has a small value called `null`

#### Other Data Types

- `date`
- `time`
- `timestamp` (`date` and `time`)

### Basic Schema Definition

`CREATE TABLE` is used to define an SQL relation.

The general form of `CREATE TABLE` is

```sql
CREATE TABLE r
(
    A1 D1,
    A2 D2,
    /* ... */
    An Dn,
    /* integrity constraints */
)
```

where `Ai` represents the name of an attribute, and `Di` is the domain of attribute `Ai`

#### Integrity Constraints

SQL supports a series of integrity constraints, to name a few:

- `primary key (key1, key2, ..., keyn)`: Specifies the primary keys.
  - The primary keys are required to be *nonnull* and *unique*.
    - No tuple can have a null value for a primary key attribute
    - No two tuples can be equal on all the primary key attributes
- `foreign key (key1, key2, ..., keyn) references s`: Values of attributes for any tuple in the relation must corresponds to values of some tuple in relation `s`
- `not null`: States that `null` is not allowed for the specified attribute.

More integrity constraints to be covered later.

### Data Manipulation Statements

#### `INSERT`

`INSERT INTO relation VALUES(val1, val2, ..., valn)`

#### `DELETE`

`DELETE FROM relation WHERE condition`

#### `DROP TABLE`

`DROP TABLE relation`

#### `ALTER TABLE`

`ALTER TABLE relation ADD attr dom`

`ALTER TABLE relation DROP attr`

## Query with SQL

### Single-Relation Queries

```sql
SELECT attributes | expression_list
FROM r /* a relation */
WHERE P /* a predicate */
```

Corresponding relational algebra:

$$ \pi_L(\sigma_P(r)) $$

#### `DISTINCT`: Removing Duplicated Entries

SQL is based on *bag semantics*. So we use the `DISTINCT` keyword to explicitly remove duplicated items.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dept_name FROM instructor
```

#### `ALL`: Retaining All Results

We use the `ALL` keyword to explicitly retain duplicated results

```sql
SELECT ALL department FROM instructor
```

#### `AS`: Renaming Results

We use the `AS` keyword to rename the expression

```sql
SELECT ID, name, salary / 12 AS monthly_salary FROM instructor
```

`AS` can also be used for renaming relations

```sql
oldname AS newname
```

In this case, `AS` is optional, and can be omitted

```sql
oldname newname
```

#### `WHERE`: Conditional Predicate

- The condition in `WHERE` can be
  - Attributes, constants, arithmetic expressions
  - `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN ... AND`, `IN`, ...
    - `<>` means `!=`
  - `AND`, `NOT`, `OR`

For example

- `tot_cred > 30 AND (dept_name='Physics' OR dept_name='Music')`
- `salary BETWEEN 9000 AND 10000`
- `semester IN ('Spring', 'Fall')`

### Output Control

#### `ORDER BY`: Sorting

```sql
ORDER BY column /* [ASC | DESC] */
```

- By default, `ORDER BY` orders items in the ascending order.
- We can sort items with more than one attributes

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM instructor
ORDER BY name
```

#### `LIMIT`: Limiting Number of Outputs

```sql
LIMIT cnt /* [offset] */
```

- Limits the number of output tuples
- Can be used in combination with `offset` to select an output 'range'

```sql
SELECT * FROM student
WHERE tot_cred > 60
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 4
```

### Strings

- Strings are quoted by single quotes `'`
- Strings are compared w.r.t. lexicographic order
- Strings can be concatenated by `str1 || str2`

#### Other String Operations

- `LOWER`
- `UPPER`
- `LENGTH`
- `TRIM`

#### `LIKE`: Pattern Matching

Operator `LIKE` accepts a pattern that is descibed by two special characters

- `%` matches any substring
- `_` matches any character
- Patterns are *case insensitive*

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor 
where name LIKE '%dar%'
```

### `NULL`

- `NULL` represents values unknown/inapplicable/withheld
- Each type has a `NULL` value

#### Operations involving `NULL`

- Arithmetic operations with `NULL` returns `NULL`
  - `NULL op val | NULL = NULL`
- Comparing operations with `NULL` returns UNKNOWN
  - `NULL com val | NUL = UNKNOWN`

`NULL` cannot be used explicitly as an operand

- `NULL + 3`: :x:
- `x = NULL`: :x:
- `x IS [NOT] NULL`: :heavy_check_mark:

### `UNKNOWN`: 3-Value Logic

There are 3 truth values in SQL: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `UNKNOWN`

Logical operations is like `MIN` and `MAX`

- `FALSE < UNKNOWN < TRUE`
- `AND` works like `min`
- `OR` works like `max`

For example

- `TRUE AND UNKNOWN -> UNKNOWN`
- `FALSE OR UNKOWN -> UNKNOWN`

Note that `NOT UNKNOWN` returns `UNKNOWN`

### Multi-Relation Query

```sql
SELECT A1, A2, ..., An
FROM r1, r2, ..., rn
WHERE P
```

The semantics of multi-relation query is

```py
for t1 in r1:
    for t2 in r2:
        # ...
        if P(t1, t2, ...):
            yield evaluate_attributes(t1, t2, ..., A1, A2, ...)
```

### Natural Join

`NARUAL JOIN` is a short version for selecting and filtering. It automatically selects tuples that have equal values in common attributes

```sql
SELECT A1, A2, ..., An
FROM r1 NATURAL JOIN r2 NATURAL JOIN ... NATURAL JOIN rn
WHERE predicate
```

### Set Operations

SQL supports `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`

> Set operations are based on *set semantics*, so set operations automatically remove duplicates. To retain all results, use the keyword `ALL` to state this explicitly.

```sql
relation1 UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT relation2
```

For example, find all courses that ran in Fall 2017 or in Spring 2018

```sql
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE sem = 'Fall' AND year = 2017)
UNION
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE sem = 'Spring' AND year = 2018)
```

### Aggregation

Operates on the multiset of values of a column of a relation. Returns a value.

- `AVG`: Average
- `MIN`: Minimum
- `MAX`: Maximum
- `SUM`: Summation
- `COUNT`: Number of values

Aggregation functions can only be used in the output of `SELECT` clauses

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
```

#### Distinct Aggregation

- `COUNT` `SUM` and `AVG` supports `DISTINCT`
  - `MIN` and `MAX` does not need to support `DISTINCT`

For example, finding the total number of instructors who teach in Spring 2010.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(ID)
FROM teaches
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010
```

#### `GROUP BY`: Projecting Tuples into Subsets

Operator `GROUP BY` projects tuples into subsets according to attributes, and aggregate within each subset

```sql
SELECT avg(tot_cred)
FROM student
GROUP BY dept_name
```

Attributes in the `SELECT` clause outside of aggretation functions must appear in the `GROUP BY` list

```sql
/* bad query */
SELECT dept_name, ID, AVG(salary)
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
```

#### `HAVING`: Filtering Grouped Aggregation

`HAVING` behaves like a `WHERE` clause for `GROUP BY`. It filters results based on aggregation computation.

```sql
SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING AVG(salary) > 42000
```

Note that `WHERE` cannot be used here.
