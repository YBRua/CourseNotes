# Introduction

## Database Systems

- **Database**: Organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world
- **DBMS**: Database Management System. Includes a database and a set of programs to access the data
- **DBA**: Database Administrator

## Database System Overview

### Outline

- Data models
- Database languages
- Database Design
- Database engine

### Data Model

**Data model** is a collection of concepts/tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and data constraints.

Different data models

- Relational model
  - Data are represented in the form of tables
- Entity-Relationship model
- Semi-Structured model
- Object-Based data model

#### Levels of Abstraction

- Physical Level
  - Describes how a record is stored
- Logical Level
  - Describes what data are stored in database, and the relationships among the data
- View Level
  - Application programs that hide details of data

### Database Languages

- Data Definition Language DDL
  - Specifies notation for defining the database schema
- Data Manipulation Language DML
  - Expresses database queries and updates
  - Procedural DML
    - Specifies what data is needed and how to get the data
  - Declarative DML
    - Specifies only what data is needed

DDL and DML usually forms parts of a single database language

#### Structured Query Language SQL

```sql
select name
from instructor
where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
```

- Non-procedural
- De facto standard

### Database Design

#### Logical Design

- To find a good collection of relational schemas
  - What attributes should be recorded in the database
  - What relation schemas we should use, and how the attributes should be distributed

### Database Engine

- Storage Manager
  - Store, retrieve, update data in the database
- Query Processor
  - The execution engine. Compiles and optimizes queries
- Transaction Manager
  - Logging, concurrency control and failure recovery

#### Storage Manager

Responsible for interaction with the file system

- Authorization and integrity manager
- File manager
- Buffer manager

Implements several data structures as part of the physical system implementation

- Data files
  - The database itself
- Data dictionary
  - Metadata
- Indices
  - For fast access to items

### Query Processor

- DDL Interpreter
  - Interprets DDL statements and records the definitions in the data dictionary
- DML Compiler
  - Translates DML statements in a query language into an evaluation plan consisting of low-level instructions
- Evaluation Engine
  - Executes low-level instructions generated by the DML compiler

### Transaction Manager

A **transaction** is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function in a database application

- e.g. Purchasing a train ticket

#### Properties

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability
