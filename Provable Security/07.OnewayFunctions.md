### One-way Function

> [KL] Section 7.1.1.

A function $\{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{0,1\}^i$ is a **one-way function** if $f$ is

- **Easy-to-Compute.** $f$ can be computed by some algorithm in $\mathrm{poly}()$.
- **Hard-to-Invert.** For every PPT $A$, there exists a negligible function $\mathrm{negl}()$ such that
  $$ \mathrm{Pr}_{x \leftarrow U_n, x' \leftarrow A(1^n, f(x))} [f(x') = f(x)] \le \mathrm{negl}(n). $$

We say $f$ is a $(t, \epsilon)$-one-way function if no probabilistic $A$ of time $t =t(n)$ can invert the function with probability more than $\epsilon = \epsilon(n)$.

#### Existence of One-way Function

- Up till now people are only *assuming* that one-way function exists.
- The existence of one-way function implies $P \neq NP$.

#### Candidates of One-way Functions

## Hardcore Predicate

## Implication of Pseudorandom Generator

If a permutation $f: \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{0,1\}^n$ has a hardcore predicate $h_c: \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{0,1\}$ (which implies that $f$ is a one-way permutation), then the function

$$ g(x) = (f(x), h_c(x)) $$

is a pseudorandom generator.

### Goldreich-Levin Theorem

## PRG from One-way Functions

### Regular Functions

$f$ is a **regular function** if the preimage size $\alpha = |f^{-1}(y)|$ is fixed (independent of $y$).

- It is a **known regular function** if its **regularity** $\alpha$ is polynomial-time computable from security parameter $n$.

### Recap: Pseudorandom Generators

### BM-Y Generator

**Theorem.** Any one-way permutation $f: \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{ 0,1 \}^n$ implies a PRG $G: \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{0,1\}^m$ for any $m = \mathrm{poly}(n)$.

### Unpredictable Pseudoentropy (UP)

A random variable $X$ has $m$ bits of **unpredictable pseudoentropy** if a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ can only win the game with probability less than $2^{-m}$.
