# Attribute Based Encryption (ABE)

## Introduction

- IBE. In IBE, the secret key $sk_{ID}$ is based on the user's $ID$.
  - One-to-one. Each $sk_{ID}$ corresponds to one single user, identified by its $ID$.
- Fuzzy IBE. Allows non-exact matches (e.g., fingerprint).
- Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE). Provides an access policy for the ciphertext.
  - One-to-more. Allows multiple users to decrypt the message.
  - E.g., "Dept. of CS AND (Phd OR Alumni)".
- Broadcast Encryption. Broadcast a ciphertext to a group of people, identified by the IDs.
  - Also one-to-more.
  - Different from ABE, BE requires knowing *all* IDs of the receivers in advance.
  - ABE only requires attributes instead of unique IDs.

### Collusion Resistance

- Assume two users, `{EE, PhD, Bill}` and `{CS, UnG, Carl}`.
- Neither of the two satisfies the access policy `{CS, PhD OR Alumni}`.
- But two of them combined will satisfy the policy.
- ABE schemes should be resilient to such collusion.

### Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE)

The encrypted data is associated with an access policy. Users' keys are generated based on the attributes of the user. A user can decrypt the message iff its attributes satisfies the access policy of the ciphertext.

CP-ABE does not need to know or specify *identities* of potential receivers. The attributes are associated with the receivers.

- A decryption key is described by an **attribute set**.
- A ciphertext is associated with an **access policy**.

### Key-Policy ABE (KP-ABE)

The data is encrypted by its attributes. Users' keys are generated based on their access policy. A user can decrypt the message iff the attribute of the data satisfies the access policy of the user.

- The attributes are associated with the data. 

E.g., consider a TV broadcasting service. Assume a video stream is associated with `{Basketball, 2024, March}`. The encrypted file is broadcasted and users who have subscribed to `Basketball` can decrypt it.

## Definition of CP-ABE

### Syntax

#### Setup

$$ \mathrm{Setup}(\lambda) \to (mpk, msk). $$

#### Encrypt

$$ \mathrm{Enc}(mpk, A, m) \to C_A. $$

- $A$: an access policy.
- $C_A$: ciphertext.

#### KeyGen

$$ \mathrm{KeyGen}(mpk, msk, S) \to sk_S. $$

- $S$: an attribute set.
- $sk_S$: a user key for the attribute set.

#### Decrypt

$$ \mathrm{Dec}(mpk, sk_S, C_A) \to m/\bot. $$

### Correctness

### Security

## Practical Considerations

To be practical, a CP-ABE system needs to have the following properties,

1. **Traitor tracing.** Traceability on malicious users who leak their decryption keys.
2. **Revocation.** Preventing revoked users from decrypting newly encrypted data.
3. **Large universe.** Any string can be used as an attribute, and attributes do not need to be pre-specified during setup.

### Traitor Tracing

- **Type 1 Traitors.** Directly leaks the key $sk_S$ for a set $S$.
- **Type 2 Traitors.** Leaks a black-box. Decryption keys and even the algorithm are hidden inside the box.

#### Black-box Traitors

##### Key-like Decryption Blackbox

The blackbox $D$ is described by an attribute set $S_D$ and can decrypt ciphertexts with access policies satisfied by $S_D$. (`S_D = { CS, PhD }`).

##### Policy-specific Decryption Blackbox

The blackbox $D$ is associated with an access policy $AP_D$, and can be decrypted with policy $AP_D$. (`AP = CS AND (PhD OR Alumni)`).

Weaker decryption ability, but reflects traitor's possible attempt to bypass detection.

If a CP-ABE scheme is policy-specific blackbox traceable, then it is also key-like blackbox traceable.

### Revocation

A key should be revoked when

- Private keys get compromised.
- User leaves the system.
- User is removed from the system for some reason.

We aim to prevent the revoked user from decrypting new ciphertexts, generated after revocation.

#### Direct Revocation

Encryption requires an additional "revocation list",

$$ \mathrm{Enc}(PP, M, R, AP). $$

- $R$: a revocation list.

#### Indirect Revocation
