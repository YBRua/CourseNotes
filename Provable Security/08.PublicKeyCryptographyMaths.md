### Divisor

**Divisor.** Let $a$, $b$ be two integers, where $b$ is non-zero, $b$ divides $a$ if there exists some integer $m$ such that $a = mb$

- Denoted by $b|a$.
- $b$ is a **divisor** of $a$.
- If $b|1$ then $b = \pm 1$.
- If $b|a$ and $a|b$ then $b = \pm a$.
- If $b|0$ then $b \neq 0$.
- If $b|g$ and $b|h$ then $b|(mg+nh)$ for any integers $m,n$.

### Congruence

**Congruence.** $a$ is **congruent to** $b$ modulo $n$ if $n | a -b$.

- Denoted by $a \equiv b \mod n$
- Congruence is an *equivalent relation*.
  - $a \equiv a \mod n$.
  - $a \equiv b \mod n$ implies $b \equiv a \mod n$.
  - $a \equiv b \mod n$ and $b \equiv c \mod n$ imply $a \equiv c \mod n$

### Modular Inverse

**Modular Inverse.** $a$ is a **modular inverse** of $b \mod n$, denoted by $b^{-1} \mod n$ if $ab \mod n = 1$.

- $3$ is the modular inverse of $5 \mod 7$. I.e., $5^{-1} \mod 7 = 3$.
- $7$ is the modular inverse of $7 \mod 16$. I.e., $7^{-1} \mod 16 =7$.

**Theorem (Existence of Modular Inverse).** There exists a modular inverse for $b \mod n$ iff $b$ is relatively prime to $n$.

#### Extended Euclidean Algorithm

The extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve the integer equation

$$ ax + by = \mathrm{gcd}(a,b) $$

The extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve for modular inverse. Suppose $\mathrm{gcd}(a,n)=1$. Compute $a^{-1} \mod n$.

- Compute $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + ny = \mathrm{gcd}(a, n)$, then $x \mod n$ is $a^{-1} \mod n$.

### The Euler Phi Function

**The Euler Phi Function $\phi(n)$.** For $n \ge 1$, $\phi(n)$ denotes the number of integers in the interval $[1, n]$ which are relatively prime to $n$. The function $\phi$ is called the **Euler Phi Function** (or the Euler Totient Function).

$$ \phi(n) =  |\{ x: 1 \le x \le n \land \mathrm{gcd}(x,n)= 1 \}| $$

### Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem (Fermat's Little Theorem).** Let $p$ be a prime. Any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$ satisfies $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$.

#### Euler's Generalization

**Theorem (Euler's Generalization).** Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then

$$ a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n $$

for any integer $a$ which is relatively prime to $n$.

**Note.** Fermat's Little Theorem is a special case of Euler's Generalization, when $n = p$ is a prime.

### Modular Exponentiation

For integer $a$ and positive integers $k,n$, if $a$ and $n$ are co-prime, then

$$ a^k \mod n = a^{k \mod \phi(n)} \mod n. $$

The implication is that we can perform $k \mod \phi(n)$ first if $k$ is large. E.g., $11^{1,073,741,823} \mod 13$.

## Group Theory

### Group

Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a set and $\circ$ be a binary operation $\circ: \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G} \mapsto \mathbb{G}$.

**Group.** $(\mathbb{G}, \circ)$ is a **group** if the following conditions hold

1. **Closure.** For all $g, h \in \mathbb{G}, g \circ h \in \mathbb{G}$.
2. **Associativity.** For all $g_1, g_2, g_3 \in \mathbb{G}, (g_1 \circ g_2) \circ g_3 = g_1 \circ (g_2 \circ g_3)$.
3. **Existence of Identity.** There exists an identity $e \in \mathbb{G}$ such that for all $g \in \mathbb{G}, e \circ g = g = g \circ e$.
4. **Existence of Inverse.** For all $g \in \mathbb{G}$ there exists an element $h \in \mathbb{G}$ such that $g \circ h = e = h \circ g$.

**Abelian Group.** A group $(\mathbb{G}, \circ)$ is **abelian** if the following holds

1. **Commutativity.** For all $g, h \in \mathbb{G}, g \circ h = h \circ g$.

When the binary operator is understood, we can simply call $\mathbb{G}$ a group.

#### More on Multiplicative Groups

Let $Z_n = \{ 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \}$ and $Z_n^* = \{ a \in Z_n | \mathrm{gcd}(a, n) = 1 \}$.

- For multiplication, not all $Z_n \backslash \{0\}$ form multiplicative groups with identity $1$.
  - It depends on the value of $n$. E.g., $n = 8$ does not form multiplicative group but $n=7$ does.

## Prime Number

### Generating Random Primes

#### Outline of the Algorithm

```py
# input: Length n, Parameter t
def get_prime(n, t):
    for i = 1 to t:
        p' = sample({0, 1}^{n-1})  # random sample a (n-1)-bit number
        p = 1||p'  # prepend 1 bit, p is an n-bit number in [2^{n-1}, 2^n-1]
        if p is prime: return p
    
    # fail if unable to find prime after t attempts
    return Failure
```

The only two problems in this algorithm outline are

1. Detemining the value of $t$.
2. Verifying if $p$ is prime.

#### Choosing $t$ (Bertrand's Postulate)

**Bertrand's Postulate.** For any $n > 1$, the fraction of $n$-bit integers that are prime is at least $1/(3n)$.

- That is, we expect at least $(2^{n}-1)/(3n)$ prime numbers.

In the prime generation algorithm, let $t = 3n^2$, the probability that the algorithm fail is

$$ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3n} \right)^t = \left( \left( 1- \frac{1}{3n} \right)^{3n} \right)^n \approx (e^{-1})^n = e^{-n} $$

which is negligible in $n$.

## Hardness Assumptions

### T.H.E. Factoring Assumption

> 大整数分解假设

Let $\mathrm{GenModulus}$ be a polynomial-time algorithm that, on input $1^n$, outputs $(N, p, q)$ where $N = pq$ and $p,q$ are $n$-bit primes (except with probability negligible in $n$).

Consider the following experiment $\mathrm{Factor}_{A, \mathrm{GenModulus}}(n)$ for a given algorithm $A$ and parameter $n$,

1. Run $\mathrm{GenModulus}(1^n)$ to obtain $(N, p, q)$.
2. $A$ outputs $p',q' > 1$ on input $N$.
3. The output of the experiment is $1$ if $p'q' = N$ and $0$ otherwise.

The factoring is **hard** relative to $\mathrm{GenModulus}$ if for all PPT algorithms $A$ there is a negligible function $\mathrm{negl}()$ such that

$$ \mathrm{Pr}\left[ \mathrm{Factor}_{A, \mathrm{GenModulus}}(n) = 1 \right] \le \mathrm{negl}(n). $$

The **factoring assumption** is the assumption that there exists a $\mathrm{GenModulus}$ relative to which factoring is hard.

The assumption could be understood in two folds

1. It is assumed that there indeed exists such a $\mathrm{GenModulus}$.
2. Given an instance of $\mathrm{GenModulus}$, it is assumed that no efficient algorithms $A$ could solve it (since we have not yet found any).

#### Instance of $\mathrm{GenModulus}$

Generate two uniform $n$-bit primes, and multiply them to get $N$.

- It is well accepted that the factoring problem is hard for the above $\mathrm{GenModulus}$ instance.

### T.H.E. RSA Assumption

Let $\mathrm{GenRSA}$ be a polynomial-time algorithm that, on input $1^n$, outputs $(N,e,d)$ where $N$ is the product of two $n$-bit primes and $e,d$ are integers such that $\mathrm{gcd}(e, \phi(N)) = 1$ and $ed = 1 \mod \phi(N)$. The algorithm may fail with probability negligible in $N$.

Consider the experiment $\mathrm{RSAInv}_{A,\mathrm{GenRSA}}(n)$ for a given algorithm $A$ and parameter $n$

1. $(N, e, d) = \mathrm{GenRSA(1^n)}$. Choose a random $y \in Z_N^*$.
2. $A$ is given $(N, e, y)$.
3. $A$ outputs $x \in Z_N^*$.
4. The experiment outputs $1$ if $x^e = y \mod N$ and $0$ otherwise.

The RSA problem is hard relative to $\mathrm{GenRSA}$ if for all PPT algorithms $A$ there is a negligible function $\mathrm{negl}()$ such that

$$ \mathrm{Pr} \left[ \mathrm{RSAInv}_{A,\mathrm{GenRSA}}(n) = 1 \right] \le \mathrm{negl}(n). $$

The **RSA Assumption** is the assumption that there exists an $\mathrm{RSAGen}$ relative to which the RSA assumption is hard.

#### Instance of $\mathrm{RSAGen}$

#### RSA Assumption vs. Factoring Assumption

Strictly speaking, the security of the RSA algorithm is based on the RSA assumption, not the factoring assumption.

### T.H.E. Discrete Logarithm Assumption

#### Discrete Logarithm

Let $\mathrm{GenGroup}$ denote a generic, polynomial-time, group-generation algorithm that, on input $1^n$, outputs a *description* of a cyclic $\mathbb{G}$, its order $q$ (with $|q| = n$) and a generator $g \in \mathbb{G}$.

- The *description* specifies how elements of the group are represented as *bit-strings*.
  - We assume that each element is represented by a unique bit-string.
- It is required that there are efficient algorithms (polynomial-time in $n$) for computing the group operation $\circ$ and testing wheter a given bit-string corresponds to an element in $\mathbb{G}$.

**Discrete Logarithm.** Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a cyclic group of order $q$ with generator $g$, we have $\mathbb{G} = \{ g^0, g^1, \dots, g^{q-1} \}$. For every $h \in \mathbb{G}$, there is a unique $x \in Z_q$ such that $h = g^x$ and this $x$ is called the **discrete logarithm** of $h$ with respect to $g$, written as $x = \log_g h$.

#### Discrete Logarithm Assumption

Consider the following experiment
