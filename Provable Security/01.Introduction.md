# Introduction

> Modern cryptography involves the study of mathematical techniques for securing digital information, systems and distributed computations against adversarial attacks.

## Classical Cryptography vs. Modern Cryptography

### Examples of Classical Cryptography

#### Caesar's Cipher

- Shift the letters of an alphabet forward/backward

#### Simple Substitution Cipher

- Each plaintext letter is mapped to and substituted by another ciphertext letter

## An Example of Modern Cryptography: Private Key Encryption

> Also known as *symmetric-key* setting. In this setting, both parties hold the same key that is used for encryption and decryption

### Syntax of Private Key Encryption

A **private-key encryption** scheme is defined by specifying a **message space** $\mathrm{M}$ along with 3 algorithms: a procedure for generating keys ($\mathrm{KeyGen}$), a procedure for encrypting ($\mathrm{Enc}$) and a procedure for decrypting ($\mathrm{Dec}$).

- $\mathrm{KeyGen}(\lambda) \to k$. The **key-generation** algorithm is a *probabilistic* algorithm that outputs a key $k$ chosen according to some random distribution.
- $\mathrm{Enc}(k, m) \to c$. The **encryption** algorithm takes a key $k$ and a message $m$ and outputs a ciphertext $c$.
- $\mathrm{Dec}(k, c) \to m$. The **decryption** algorithm takes a key $k$ and a ciphertext $c$ and outputs a plaintext $m$.

### Correctness

A private key encryption scheme must satisfy the following **correctness** requirement: for any $k$ output by $\mathrm{KeyGen}$ and every message $m \in \mathcal{M}$ it holds that

$$ \mathrm{Dec}(k, \mathrm{Enc}(k, m)) = m. $$

### Security and Kerckhoff's Principle

The intuition of "security" is that "the attacker cannot break the scheme".

- Keeping the secret key is a necessary/basic requirement for security.
- But what about other components? The decryption algorithm? The encryption algorithm? The entire scheme?

#### Kerckhoff's Principle

**Kerckhoff's Principle.** The cipher method must not be required to be secret, and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience.

- A cryptographic scheme should be designed to be secure even if an attacker knows all the details of the scheme, so long as the attacker does not know the key being used.
- Security should not rely on the scheme being secret; instead it should rely solely on the secrecy of the key.

##### Arguments in Favor of Kerckhoff's Principle

1. It is significantly easier for the parties to maintain secrecy of a short key than to keep secret the (more complicated) algorithm they are using.
   - It is simply unrealistic to assume that the encryption algorithm will remain secret.
2. In case the honest parties' secret information is ever exposed, it is much easier to change a key than to change the entire scheme.
3. For large-scale deployment, it is significantly easier for users to all rely on the same encryption algorithm than for everyone to use their custom ones.

##### No "Security by Obscurity"

- Cryptography design should be made completely public.
- Published designs undergo public review and are likely to be stronger.
- Confidence in the security of a scheme is much higher if it has been extensively studied.
