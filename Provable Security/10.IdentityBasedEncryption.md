# Identity-Based Encryption

## Introduction to IBE

### IBE

- Does not require exchanging private or public keys
- Does not require keeping key directories
- Does not require a third party
- Requires a trusted key generation center
  - Suitable for communication between branches of international companies, where the headquarter can serve as this center

## Syntax of IBE

### Setup

$$ \mathrm{Setup}(\lambda) \to (mpk, msk) $$

- Takes as input a security parameter $\lambda$.
- Outputs a system master key pair $(mpk, msk)$.

### Encryption

$$ \mathrm{Enc}(mpk, id, m) \to c $$

- Takes as input the system's master public key $mpk$, an identity string $id$, and a message $m$ from message space $M$
- Outputs a ciphertext $c$

Note that the encryption does not require the user's public key (or private key). Instead it only requires a string $id$. That is, the ciphertext can be generated *before* the generation of a user's key.

### KeyGen

$$ \mathrm{KeyGen}(mpk, msk, id) \to sk_{id} $$

### Decryption

$$ \mathrm{Dec}(mpk, sk_{id}, c) \to m $$

### Math: Bilinear Map Groups

#### Bilinear Map

Let $G$ and $G_T$ be two (multiplicative) cyclic groups of prime order $p$, $g$ be a generator of $G$. A map $e: G \times G \mapsto G_T$ is referred to as a **bilinear map** if the following properties hold,

- **Bilinear.** For all $u, v \in G$ and $a, b \in Z$, it holds that $e(u^a, v^b) = e(u, v)^{ab}$.
- **Non-degenerate.** $e(g, g) \neq \mathbf{1}_{G_T}$. (Or otherwise bilinearity would be trivial).

Note that $e(\cdot,\cdot)$ is symmetric.

#### Bilinear Group

We say $G$ is a **bilinear group** if the group operation in $G$ can be *computed efficiently* and there exists a group $G_T$ and an efficiently computable bilinear map $e: G \times G \mapsto G_T$. 

#### (Computational) Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Assumptions

GIven a bilinear group generation algorithm $\mathrm{GenGroup}$, $(G, G_T, p, g, e) \leftarrow \mathrm{GenGroup}(1^\lambda)$. The advantage of an algorithm $A$ in solving Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem relative to $\mathrm{GenGroup}$ is defined as

$$ \mathrm{Adv}_{A}^{BDH} = \mathrm{Pr}[] $$

#### On the Hardness of Assumptions

On a bilinear group $G$,

  DBDH--->DDHG[DDH on G]
  DLogGT[DLog on GT]--->DBDH
  CDHGT[CDH on GT]--->DBDH
```

- DDH is NOT difficult on a bilinear group $G$, by simply checking whether $e(g^a, g^b) = e(g, T)$: if $T = g^{ab}$ then the equation should hold.

## An IBE Instance

### Anonymous IBE

**Intuition.** The challenger chooses one of $id_0, id_1$ and one of $m_0, m_1$. The adversary guesses the $(id, m)$ pair, with a random guess chance of $1/4$.

$$ \mathrm{Adv}_{A}^{ANON-IND-ID-CPA} = \left| \mathrm{Pr} [b = b' \land c = c'] - \frac{1}{4} \right| $$

An IBE scheme is $(t, q_{ID}, \epsilon)$-ANON-IND-ID-CPA secure if all $t$-time IND-ID-CPA adversaries making at most $q_{ID}$ private key queries have an advantage of at most $\epsilon$ in winning the game.
