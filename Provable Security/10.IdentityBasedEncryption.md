# Identity-Based Encryption

## Introduction to IBE

### IBE

- Does not require exchanging private or public keys
- Does not require keeping key directories
- Does not require a third party
- Requires a trusted key generation center
  - Suitable for communication between branches of international companies, where the headquarter can serve as this center

## Syntax of IBE

### Setup

$$ \mathrm{Setup}(\lambda) \to (mpk, msk) $$

- Takes as input a security parameter $\lambda$.
- Outputs a system master key pair $(mpk, msk)$.

### Encryption

$$ \mathrm{KeyGen}(mpk, id, m) \to c $$

- Takes as input the system's master public key $mpk$, an identity string $id$, and a message $m$ from message space $M$
- Outputs a ciphertext $c$

Note that the encryption does not require the user's public key (or private key). Instead it only requires a string $id$. That is, the ciphertext can be generated *prior to* the generation of a user's key.
