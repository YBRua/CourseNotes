# Parallel and Distributed Storage

## Data Partition

**I/O parallelism** refers to reducing the time required to retrieve data from disk by partitioning the data over multiple disks.

- **Horizontal partitioning.** The tuples of a relation are partitioned among many nodes, where each tuple resides in one node.
- **Vertical partitioning.** The attributes of a relation are partitioned among nodes.
  - E.g., suitable for applications where some attributes are frequently used.

### Partitioning Strategies

- **Round-robin.** Ensures an even distribution of tuples across nodes.
- **Hash paritioning.**
  - Designates one or more attributes in a tuple as the partitioning attributes.
  - Compute hash on the partitioning attributes and place the tuple to nodes accordingly.
- **Range partitioning.** Distributes tuples by assigning contiguous attribute-value ranges to each node.
  - Select a paritioning attribute

#### Maintaining the Partition

- When a tuple is inserted, it is distributed to the appropriate node according to the partitioning strategy.
- When a tuple is removed, it is first found based on the partitioning attribute and then removed.
  - For round-robin, all nodes search for this node in parallel.
- When a node is updated and the partitioning attribute is updated
  - It will be removed from the original node and sent to a new node according to the updated value.
  - No need to change location if is round-robin or it does not update partitioning attribute.

#### Comparison of Partitioning Techniques

We consider three types of access to data items.

1. Scanning the entire relation.
2. Point queries. Seek tuples that have a specified value for a specific attribute.
3. Range queries. Locating all tuples for which the value of a given attribute lies within a specified range.

- **Round-robin.**
  - Suitable for scanning the entire relation. All nodes can execute in parallel, and the runtime does not vary too much.
  - Not suitable for point or ranged queries. All nodes need to be scanned.
- **Hash partitioning.**
  - Suitable for (1) point queries on partitioning attributes. (2) Scanning the entire relation.
  - Not suitable for point queries on other attributes or ranged queries.
- **Range Partitioning.**
  - Suitable for point or ranged queries on partitioning attributes.
  - **Execution skew.** If there are many tuples in the queried range, many tuples need to be retrieved from a few nodes, resulting in I/O bottlenecks.
