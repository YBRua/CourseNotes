# Recovery

## Failure Classification

- **Transaction Failure.**
  - **Logic Error.** The transaction can no longer continue with its normal execution because of some internal condition
  - **System Error.** The system has entered an undesirable state (e.g., deadlock), as a result of which a transaction cannot continue with its normal execution
- **System Crash.** Hardware malfunction, or a bug in the database software or OS that causes the loss of the content of volatile storage and halts transaction processing.
  - **Fail-stop Assumption.** Assumes the halt does not corrupt non-volatile storage.
- **Disk Failure.** A disk block loses its content.

## Log-based Recovery

- To achieve atomicity, the DBMS first outputs information *describing the modifications* to stable storage, before actually modifying the database itself.
- The most widely used structure for recording database modifications is the **log**.
- The **log** is a sequence of **log records**.

### Types of Log Records

- **Update log record.** $<T_i, X, V_{old}, V_{new}>$ describes a write operation, it contains
  - Transaction ID $T_i$, data item $X$, old and new values $V_{old}$, $V_{new}$.
- **Start of Transaction.** $<T_i, \mathtt{start}>$
- **Commit of Transaction.** $<T_i, \mathtt{commit}>$
- **Abort of Transaction.** $<T_i, \mathtt{abort}>$
