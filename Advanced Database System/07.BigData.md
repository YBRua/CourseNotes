# Big Data

## Introduction

Big Data has been contrasted with traditional relational databases on the following metrics

- **Volume.** The amount of data to be stored and processed is much higher.
- **Velocity.** The rate of arrival of data is much higher.
  - Data management system must be able to ingest and store data at very high rates.
  - Many applications require data items to be processed as they arrive (streaming data systems)
- **Variety.** Not all data are relational.
  - Semi-structured data, textual data, graph data, etc.

The **big data** in the textbook generally refers to any data-processing that require a high degree of parallelism to handle.

### Querying Big Data

There are two categories of applications related to big data

1. Transaction processing system that need very high scalability.
   - It is much easier to scale a transaction processing system if we relax the requirements to support all features in a relational database.
   - Conversely, most systems that need to scale can manage without full database support.
   - The primary mode of data access for such applications is a **key-value store**, where data is stored and retrieved with an associated key.
2. Query processing systems that need very high scalability, and need to support non-relational data.
