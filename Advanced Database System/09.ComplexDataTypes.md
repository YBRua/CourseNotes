# Complex Data Types

- Traditional relational model requires that *data values be atomic*.
- Multivalued, composite, and other complex data types are not allowed by the core relational model.

## Semi-Structured Data

### Motivation

- Relational database have tables with a *fixed* number of attributes.
  - Each of which contains an atomic value.
  - Changes to the schema are rare, and might require changing application code.
- Many applications need to store more complex data whose schemas often change.
- Another motivation for semi-structured data is data exchange (e.g., server-client data exchange in web applications)

### Overview of Semi-Structured Data Models

#### Flexible Schema

**Wide Column.** Some database systems allow each tuple to potentially have a different set of attributes. Such a representation is referred to as a **wide column** data representation.

**Sparse Column.** A more restricted version of the wide column representation is to have a fixed but very large number of attributes. Each tuple only uses the attributes that it needs, leaving the rest with null values.

#### Multivalued Data

- Many databases allow the storage of *non-atomic values*.
  - Sets, multisets.
  - Key-value maps.
  - Arrays.

#### Nested Data Types

- JSON, XML

#### Knowledge Representation

- Resource Description Format (RDF)

### JSON

- JavaScript Object Notation.
- A textual representation of complex data types that is widely used between applications for communication.

### XML

- The XML data representation adds **tags** enclosed in angled brackets to mark up information in a textual representation.
- Tags can be used to represent relational data by specifying relation names and attributes as tags.

### RDF

- The **Resource Description Framework (RDF)** is a data representation standard based on the *entity-relation* model.
- Represents data by a set of **triples** in one of the two forms
  1. (id, attribute-name, value)
  2. (id1, relationship, id2)
- id, id1, id2 are identifiers of *entities* (a.k.a. *resources* in RDF).
- Only supports binary relationships; does not support n-ary relationships.
  - n-ary relationships can be converted to multiple binary relationships.

#### Knowledge Graph

- The RDF data has a very natural graph representation, known as **knowledge graphs**.
  - Entities and attributes are nodes.
  - Attribute names and relationships are edges.

#### SPARQL

- A query language designed to query RDF data, based on triple patterns.
- Looks like RDF triples, but contains variables.

```sparql
// matches all triples whose predicate is "title" and object is "Intro. to CS"
?cid title "Introduction to Computer Science"
```

## Object Orientation

The **object-relational data modle** extends the relational data model by providing a *richer* type system.
